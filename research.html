        <h3>Feasibility Study to Implement Hydrothermal Liquefaction in Southeast Michigan</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy </p>
        <p>This study is a collaborative effort between the SWR2L, the Great Lakes Water Authority, Pacific Northwest National Lab, Brown and Caldwell, Genifuel, and two academic institutions: the University of Michigan and Wayne State University. Our central aim is to measure the sustainability of hydrothermal liquefaction for treating sewage sludge. To achieve this, we are performing a life cycle assessment, a techno-economic analysis, and considering social aspects through interaction with the Delray community, a neighborhood located near the Water Resource Recovery Facility. Additionally, we are actively testing the technology using Genifuel’s pilot unit directly at the water resource recovery facility. </p>

        <h3>Treatment &amp; Treatment and resource recovery from hydrothermal liquefaction aqueous by-product </h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy , Water Research Foundation, The Great Lakes Water Authority </p>
        <p>Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) is a chemical process that converts organic wastes into biocrude, which serves as a precursor for transportation fuels. However, in addition to biocrude, HTL also generates a medium-to-high strength aqueous byproduct (HTL-aq). For HTL to be successfully implemented, it is crucial to thoroughly understand and ensure the sustainable treatment of this HTL-aq. Under this project, we are employing anaerobic digestion and chemical processes to recover both biogas and ammonia from the HTL-aq. Furthermore, we are evaluating the treatment of HTL-aq in bioreactors designed to simulate the activated sludge processes typically found in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRFs).</p>

        <h3>Evaluating transformation and fate of PFAS during hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong>  U.S. Department of Energy </p>
        <p>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants that are threatening the applicatio of biosolids for agricultural purposes. Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) could offer a promising solution for the removal of PFAS. For this project, we are evaluating the transformation and fate of PFAS within a pilot-scale, continuous HTL reactor provided by Genifuel. We are measuring PFAS concentrations in the influent, as well as in all the effluents produced by the HTL process, including biocrude, gas, liquid, and solid streams</p>

        <h3>Evaluating nitrification inhibition by propylene glycol in Austin Water Resource Recovery Facility</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> City of Austin (AW)</p>
        <p>In this collaboration with Austin Water we are using bench scale bioreactors to simulate Austin Water secondary treatment and study the inhibition of nitrifying bacteria by propylene glycol.</p>

        <h3>Unleashing Anaerobic Fungi in Anaerobic Digestion</h3>
        <p><strong>Funding:</strong> University of Texas at Austin</p>
        <p>Lignocellulosic biomass is broadly available in the US and the conversion of these feedstocks into biofuels or biomaterials through anaerobic digestion could increase the amount of US energy sources dramatically. However, the conversion of lignocellulose to biofuels requires costly and environmental damaging pretreatments to make plant material bioavailable. Anaerobic fungi, belonging to the phylum Neocallimastigomycota, can provide a solution for this. Anaerobic fungi are inherent in the rumen and are responsible for the digestion of plant material in ruminants (cows, sheep…). We are working in developing bioprocesses that simulate the rumen in order to grow anaerobic fungi.</p>
